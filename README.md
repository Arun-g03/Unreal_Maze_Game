HELLO!!


The purpose of this code is to try to procedurally generate a square maze where, using 4 generation algorithms, generate paths in turns/roun For Unreal Engine.

the basic version of the code works however, the goal now is to shift the generation part into its own thread (multithreading) so that Unreal Engine thread isnt overloaded.
